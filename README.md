# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science & IT Management 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am doing a minor in Data Analysis and am very interested in that field!
- I am interested in learning about how to identify patterns in the real world using statistical programming
