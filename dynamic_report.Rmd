## What kinds of ads are people seeing?

This report uses data from a Google Form where people recorded Instagram ads they saw, including the product type, brand, and how many times they saw it.

There were **`r num_responses`** responses.

On average, people saw each ad **`r round(mean_seen, 1)`** times â€” with the most frequently seen ad shown **`r max_seen`** times.

### Ad types: What products are most advertised?

```{r}
latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = ad_type), fill = "#6495ED") +
  labs(title = "Number of Ads by Product Type",
       x = "Product Type",
       y = "Count",
       caption = "Source: Google Form Responses") +
  theme_minimal()
```

*This chart shows which types of products appeared most often in the reported ads.*

### Top brands: Who's advertising the most?

```{r}
latest_data %>%
  count(brand, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(brand, -n), y = n), stat = "identity", fill = "#FFA07A") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Frequently Advertised Brands",
       x = "Brand",
       y = "Number of Mentions",
       caption = "Source: Google Form Responses") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

*These are the ten brands that appeared most frequently in the data.*
